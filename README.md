# Java_Dijkstras_Algorithm
This ia a progrma for Dijkstra's Algorithm implemented into Java. 

Just as a preface, this program was made during an alternative assessement from the University
of Bath due to COVID-19. As such, the majority of the code has been created by the professors. All the code that 
directly influences the "questions" have been made by me.
